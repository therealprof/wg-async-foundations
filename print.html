<p>This working group is focused around implementation/design of the “foundations” for Async I/O. This means that we are focused on designing and implementing extensions to the language, standard library, and other &quot;core&quot; bits of support offered by the Rust organization. We do not directly work on external projects like <a href="https://tokio.rs/">tokio</a>, <a href="https://async.rs/">async-std</a>, <a href="https://github.com/smol-rs/smol/">smol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/akiles/embassy">embassy</a> and so forth, although we definitely discuss ideas and coordinate with them where appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="zulip"><a class="header" href="#zulip">Zulip</a></h2>
<p>We hold discussions on <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187312-wg-async-foundations">the <code>#wg-async-foundations</code> stream in Zulip</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-this"><a class="header" href="#what-is-this">What is this</a></h2>
<p>Async-await first [stabilized] in November 2019, and today people are building all kinds of applications using it. We believe Rust can become one of the most popular choices for building distributed systems, ranging from embedded devices to foundational cloud services.</p>
<p>Regardless of their application, we want all developers to love using Async Rust. For that to happen, we need to move Async Rust beyond the &quot;MVP&quot; state it's in today and make it accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>This document is a collaborative effort to build a shared vision for Async Rust. <strong>Our goal is to engage the entire community in a collective act of the imagination:</strong> how can we make the end-to-end experience of using Async I/O not only a pragmatic choice, but a <em>joyful</em> one?</p>
<h2 id="involving-the-whole-community"><a class="header" href="#involving-the-whole-community">Involving the whole community</a></h2>
<p>Building a truly great experience for Async Rust takes more than just <code>async fn</code>. We need to think about the end-to-end experience -- everything from what happens when people first learn Async Rust, to what happens as they are building their application, to what happens after deployment.</p>
<p>The challenge for us is to drive that holistic product experience while retaining the loosely coupled, exploration-oriented ecosystem we have built. Async Rust was intentionally designed not to have a &quot;one size fits all&quot; mindset, and we don't want to change that. But we need a forum where we can coordinate on the overall experience we are all shooting for. That is what this document is for!</p>
<h2 id="the-vision-drives-the-work"><a class="header" href="#the-vision-drives-the-work">The vision drives the work</a></h2>
<p>The vision is not just idle speculation. It is the central document that we use to organize ourselves. When we think about our <a href="./vision/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> for any given year, it is always with the aim of moving us closer to the vision we lay out here.</p>
<h2 id="-under-construction-help-needed-"><a class="header" href="#-under-construction-help-needed-">🚧 Under construction! Help needed! 🚧</a></h2>

<h1 id="-design-tenets-for-async"><a class="header" href="#-design-tenets-for-async">✏️ Design tenets for async</a></h1>
<table><thead><tr><th>Status</th><th>Owner</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>⚠️ Draft ⚠️</td><td>nikomatsakis</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Draft status.</strong> These tenets are a first draft. nikomatsakis plans to incorporate feedback and revise them before they are finalized.</p>
<p>The design tenets describe the key principles that drive our work on async. Hopefully, we are able to achieve and honor all of them all of the time. Sometimes, though, they come into conflict, and we have to pick -- in that case, we prefer the tenet earlier in the list.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Minimal overhead.</strong> Rust Async I/O performance should compare favourably with any other language. In the extreme case, it should be possible to use async/await without any required allocation, although this is unlikely to be a common case in production systems.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to get started, but able to do anything you want.</strong> We should make it simple to write Async I/O code and get things that work reasonably well, but it should be possible for people to obtain fine-grained control as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Async is like sync, but with blocking points clearly identified.</strong> At the highest level, writing a simple program using asynchronous I/O in Rust should be analogous to writing one that uses synchronous I/O, except that one adds <code>async</code> in front of function declarations and adds <code>.await</code> after each call. We should aim for analogous design between synchronous and asynchronous equivalents. Similarly, streams should be like asynchronous iterators. One should be able to use the same sort of combinators with streams and to iterate over them in analogous ways.</li>
<li><strong>No one true runtime.</strong> We need to be able to hook into existing runtimes in different environments, from embedded environments to runtimes like node.js. Specialized systems need specialized runtimes. </li>
<li><strong>Library ecosystem is key.</strong> We want to have a strong ecosystem of async crates, utilities, and frameworks. This will require mechanisms to write libraries/utilities/frameworks that are generic and interoperable across runtimes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="stress-tests"><a class="header" href="#stress-tests">Stress tests</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Stress tests&quot; are important use cases that tend to &quot;stretch&quot; the design. When we are contemplating changes, it's important to look over the stress tests and make sure that they all still work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-threaded executors:</strong> Some systems tie each task to a single thread; such tasks should be able to access data that is not <code>Send</code> or <code>Sync</code>, and the executor for those tasks should be able to be fully optimized to avoid atomic accesses, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-threaded executors:</strong> Many systems migrate tasks between threads transparently, and that should be supported as well, though tasks will be required to be <code>Send</code>.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Bring your own runtime&quot;:</strong> The Rust language itself should not require that you start threads, use epoll, or do any other particular thing.</li>
<li><strong>Zero allocation, single task:</strong> Embedded systems might want to be able to have a single task that is polled to completion and which does no allocation whatsoever.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple runtimes in one process:</strong> Sometimes people have to combine systems, each of which come with their own event loop. We should avoid assuming there is one global event loop in the system. </li>
<li><strong>Non-Rust based runtimes:</strong> Sometimes people want to integrate into event loops from other, non-Rust-based systems.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly in the browser:</strong> We want to integrate with WebAssembly.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="-cast-of-characters"><a class="header" href="#-cast-of-characters">🙋‍♀️ Cast of characters</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-this-1"><a class="header" href="#what-is-this-1">What is this?</a></h2>
<p>We've created four characters that we use to help drive the &quot;status quo&quot; stories. These four individuals help us to give color to the stories, but of course four people can't cover the full range of people using Async Rust. We've also defined a number of <a href="vision/characters.html#axes">axes</a> that give a more complete description.</p>
<h2 id="the-characters"><a class="header" href="#the-characters">The characters</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="vision/./characters/alan.html">Alan: the full stack developer</a></li>
<li><a href="vision/./characters/grace.html">Grace: the full stack developer</a></li>
<li><a href="vision/./characters/niklaus.html">Niklaus: the developer building generic Rust libraries and frameworks</a></li>
<li><a href="vision/./characters/barbara.html">Barbara: embedded developer doing networking</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="axes"><a class="header" href="#axes">Axes</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;axes&quot; are how we categorize and think about the space of people that are using Async Rust. The characters above all represent important points in this &quot;user space&quot;, but sometimes it's useful to have a more complete picture.</p>
<p>This list will probably never be complete! If you don't see yourself in the answers listed here, please feel free to suggest additions. (<a href="vision/./how_to_vision_doc.html#adding-or-adjusting-the-axes-or-set-of-characters">Instructions here.</a>)</p>

<h3 id="alan-the-full-stack-developer"><a class="header" href="#alan-the-full-stack-developer">Alan: the full stack developer</a></h3>
<p>Alan is a &quot;full stack&quot; developer who has been solving problems for customers in many companies. He's used node.js, Ruby-on-Rails, Django, and a couple other frameworks besides. Alan was recently hired at <code>fido.io</code>, a pioneering dog-food delivery business that uses a combination of deep learning and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">IoT</a> to select the optimum dog food for your pet's health. Fido has chosen to build their networking stack in Rust. They were already using Rust for their deep learning code and they wanted to keep to a single language. For the time being, their needs are relatively simple. They want to stand up a server that serves up pages and connects to various back-end and cloud services.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this-3"><a class="header" href="#what-is-this-3">What is this</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;status quo&quot; stories document the experience of using Async Rust today. Each story narrates the challenges encountered by <a href="vision/./characters.html">one of our characters</a> as they try (and typically fail in dramatic fashion) to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Writing &quot;status quo&quot; stories helps us compensate for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge">curse of knowledge</a> -- in particular, the folks working on Async Rust tend to be experts in Async Rust. We've gotten used to the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/07_workarounds/01_chapter.html">workarounds</a> required to be productive, and we know the little tips and tricks that can get you out of a jam. </p>
<p>Writing the &quot;status quo&quot; stories gives us a concrete way to put ourselves in <a href="vision/./characters.html">our characters'</a> shoes. They help us to estimate the cumulative impact all the paper cuts can have on someone still learning their way around. This gives us the data we need to prioritize.</p>
<h3 id="based-on-a-true-story"><a class="header" href="#based-on-a-true-story">Based on a true story</a></h3>
<p>These stories are not made up. They are always based on real-life experiences of actual people. Each story contains a &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; section, and that will include notes the sources used to create the story. In some cases, it may link to notes or summaries in the <a href="vision/../conversations.html">conversations</a> section, though that is not required. The &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; section also contains a summary of what the &quot;morals&quot; of the story are (i.e., what are the key takeaways), along with answers to questions that people have raised along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Just because a user story is represented here doesn't mean we're going to be able to fix it right now.</strong> Some of these user stories will indicate more severe problems than others. As we consider the stories, we'll select some subset to try and address; that choice is reflected in the <a href="vision/./roadmap.html">roadmap</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What are the morals of the story?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many people cite that picking a runtime is a stressful choice.</li>
<li>People want to be able to 'mix and match' the runtime, web framework, and other libraries and have things just work.</li>
<li>Information on async-await is hard to find and not yet well integrated into standard Rust learning materials.</li>
<li>Rust's async model is different from other languages (JavaScript, C#) and that can be confusing.</li>
<li>Learning async Rust is strictly more work than learning sync Rust, which is already harder than we'd like.</li>
<li>The async book as written gives way too many low-level details way too early.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Are you just making this stuff up?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Not at all. This is based on a number of sources, including tweets but also personal conversations.</li>

<p>When examining metrics for her service in the past, Grace has noticed tail latencies in the P99 that exceed their SLA, and identified GC in the routing layer as the problem. She decides to investigate rewriting the routing service in Rust. A few months of frantic hacking follow:</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ule4vhcY1xEKQ/giphy.gif" alt="montage of cats typing" width=200></img></p>
<p>Soon enough, she and her team have a proof of concept working. They run some local stress tests and notice that 5% of requests hang and fail to respond and the client eventually times out. She is unable to reproduce this problem when running one-off requests locally, it only shows up when sending above 200 requests-per-second. </p>
<p>She realizes that she doesn't have any tooling that can give her insight into what's going on. She starts to add lots of logging, attempting to tie log entries to specific connections. Using an operating system tool, she is able to identify the socket addresses for the hung connections, so she also includes the socket addresses in each log message. She can then grep the logs to find those that are associated with the hung connections. Of course, the logs only tell her what the connection managed to do successfully, they don't tell her why it stopped -- so she has to keep going back and adding more logs until she can narrow down the exact call that hangs.</p>
<p>Eventually, she identifies that the last log message is right before calling the HMAC authentication library that is written C, and is synchronous, but only when refreshing the private authentication token from the source of truth. </p>

<p>The &quot;shiny future&quot; is here to tell you what we are trying to build over the next 2-3 years. That is, it presents our &quot;best guess&quot; as to what will look like a few years from now. When describing specific features, it also embeds links to <a href="vision/../design_notes.html">design notes</a> that describe the constraints and general plans around that feature.</p>

<p>You'll notice that the ideas in this document are <strong>maximalist and ambitious</strong>. They stake out an opinionated position on how the ergonomics of Async I/O should feel. This position may not, in truth, be attainable, and for sure there will be changes along the way. Sometimes the realities of how computers actually work may prevent us from doing all that we'd like to. That's ok. This is a dream and a goal.</p>
<p>We fully expect that the designs and narratives described in this document will change as we work towards realizing them. When there are areas of particular uncertainty, we use the Frequently Asked Questions and the design docs to call them out.</p>

<ul>
<li>What makes this application different from most others?</li>
<li>What are some examples of crates in this category?

</li>
<li>How should I describe the &quot;evidence&quot; for my status quo story?
<ul>
<li>The more specific you can get, the better. If you can link to tweets or blog posts, that's ideal. You can also add notes into the <a href="vision/../conversations.html">conversations</a> folder and link to those. Of course, you should be sure people are ok with that.</li>

<h2 id="project-board"><a class="header" href="#project-board">Project board</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/2">project board</a> tracks various bugs and other work items for the async foundation group.
It is used to drive the triage process.</p>
<h2 id="triage-process"><a class="header" href="#triage-process">Triage process</a></h2>
<p>In our weekly triage meetings, we take new issues assigned <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-async-await"><code>A-async-await</code></a> and categorize them. 
The process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/2">project board</a>, from right to left:
<ul>
<li>Look at what got <strong>Done</strong>, and celebrate! :tada:</li>
<li>Review <strong>In progress</strong> issues to check we are making progress and there is a clear path to finishing (otherwise, move to the appropriate column)</li>
<li>Review <strong>Blocked</strong> issues to see if there is anything we can do to unblock</li>
<li>Review <strong>Claimed</strong> issues to see if they are in progress, and if the assigned person still intends to work on it</li>
<li>Review <strong>To do</strong> issues and assign to anyone who wants to work on something</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-async-await+is%3Aopen+-label%3AAsyncAwait-Triaged&amp;type=Issues">uncategorized issues</a>
<ul>
<li>Mark <code>P-low</code>, <code>P-medium</code>, or <code>P-high</code></li>
<li>Add <code>P-high</code> and <em>assigned</em> <code>E-needs-mentor</code> issues to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/projects/2">project board</a></li>
<li>Mark <code>AsyncAwait-triaged</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there's still a shortage of <strong>To do</strong> issues, review the list of <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+is%3Aissue+label%3AAsyncAwait-Triaged+label%3AP-medium+is%3Aopen&amp;type=Issues"><code>P-medium</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+is%3Aissue+label%3AAsyncAwait-Triaged+label%3AP-low+is%3Aopen&amp;type=Issues"><code>P-low</code></a> issues for candidates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mentoring"><a class="header" href="#mentoring">Mentoring</a></h2>
<p>If an issue is a good candidate for mentoring, mark <code>E-needs-mentor</code> and try to find a mentor.</p>
<p>Mentors assigned to issues should write up mentoring instructions. 
<strong>Often, this is just a couple lines pointing to the relevant code.</strong> 
Mentorship doesn't require intimate knowledge of the compiler, just some familiarity and a willingness to look around for the right code.</p>
<p>After writing instructions, mentors should un-assign themselves, add <code>E-mentor</code>, and remove <code>E-needs-mentor</code>. 
On the project board, if a mentor is assigned to an issue, it should go to the <strong>Claimed</strong> column until mentoring instructions are provided. 
After that, it should go to <strong>To do</strong> until someone has volunteered to work on it.</p>
<h1 id="-design-documents"><a class="header" href="#-design-documents">🔬 Design documents</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>design documents</strong> (or &quot;design docs&quot;, more commonly) describe potential designs. These docs vary greatly in terms of their readiness to be implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early on, they describe a vague idea for a future. Often this takes the shape of capturing constraints on the solution, rather than the solution itself.</li>
<li>When a feature is getting ready to ship, they can evolve into a full blown RFC, with links to tracking issues or other notes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="early-stage-design-docs"><a class="header" href="#early-stage-design-docs">Early stage design docs</a></h2>
<p>In the early stages, design docs are meant to capture interesting bits of &quot;async design space&quot;. They are often updated to capture the results of a fruitful conversation or thread which uncovered contraints or challenges in solving a particular problem. They will capture a combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>use cases;</li>
<li>interesting aspects to the design;</li>
<li>alternatives;</li>
<li>interactions with other features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="late-stage-design-docs"><a class="header" href="#late-stage-design-docs">Late stage design docs</a></h2>
<p>As a design progresses, the doc should get more and more complete, until it becomes something akin to an RFC. (Often, at that point, we will expand the design document into a directory, adding an actual RFC draft and other contents; those things can live in this repo or elsewhere, depending.) Once we decide to put a design doc onto the roadmap, it will also contain links to tracking issues or other places to track the status.</p>
<h1 id="-yield-safe-lint"><a class="header" href="#-yield-safe-lint">⚠️ Yield-safe lint</a></h1>
<h2 id="use-case"><a class="header" href="#use-case">Use-case</a></h2>
<p>Some types should not be held across a &quot;yield&quot; bound. A typical example is a <code>MutexGuard</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">async fn example(x: &amp;Lock&lt;u32&gt;) {
    let data = x.lock().unwrap();
    something().await;
    *data += 1;
}

async fn something() { }
</code></pre>
<p>In practice, a lot of these issues are avoided because <code>MutexGuard</code> is not <code>Send</code>, but single-thread runtimes hit these issues.</p>
<h2 id="types-where-this-would-apply"><a class="header" href="#types-where-this-would-apply">Types where this would apply</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>MutexGuard</code> for mutexes, read-write locks</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="precedent-and-related-questions"><a class="header" href="#precedent-and-related-questions">Precedent and related questions</a></h2>
<ul>

<li>e.g., <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.poll_next_unpin"><code>poll_next_unpin</code></a> can make working with pin easier, albeit at a loss of generality
<ul>
<li>folks who are new to pinning could use this method, and it can help us to guide the diagnostics by suggesting that they <code>Box::pin</code></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>It would be useful to be able to write a function to return an iterator or (in the async context) a generator</li>
<li>The basic shape might be (modulo bikeshedding) <code>gen fn</code> that contains <code>yield</code></li>
<li>Some question marks:
<ul>
<li>How general of a mechanism do we want?
<ul>
<li>Just target iterators and streams, or shoot for something more general?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some of the question marks that arise if you go beyond iterators and streams:
<ul>
<li>Return values that are not unit</li>
<li>Have yield return a value that is passed by the caller of <code>next</code> (&quot;resume args&quot;)</li>
</ul>

<li>&quot;I wasn't expecting that it will be easy but after Go and Node.js development it felt extremely hard to start off anything with Rust.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;felt like I have to re-learn everything from scratch: structuring project and modules, dependency injection, managing the DB and of course dealing with concurrency&quot;</li>
<li>common thread: poor docs, though only somewhat in async libraries
<ul>
<li>I had enums in the DB and it was a bit more complex to map them to my custom Rust enums but I succeeded with the help of a couple of blog posts – and not with Diesel documentation</li>
<li>I used Rusoto for dealing with AWS services. It's also pretty straightforward and high quality package – but again the documentation was sooo poor. </li>

<li><a href="https://t.co/4rlyfUlFES?amp=1">implaustin</a> wrote a <a href="https://t.co/4rlyfUlFES?amp=1">very nice post</a> but it felt more like a &quot;look how well this worked&quot; post than one with actionable feedback
<ul>
<li>&quot;Async has worked well so far.  My top wishlist items are Sink and Stream traits in std.  It's quite difficult to abstract over types that asynchronously produce or consume values.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;AsyncRead/AsyncWrite work fine for files, tcp streams, etc.  But once you are past I/O and want to pass around structs, Sink and Stream are needed.  One example of fragmentation is that Tokio channels used to implement the futures Sink/Stream traits, but no longer do in 1.0.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I usually use Sink/Stream to abstract over different async channel types.  Sometimes to hide the details of external dependencies from a task (e.g. where is this data going?).  And sometimes to write common utility methods.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;One thing I can think of: there are still a lot of popular libraries that don't have async support (or are just getting there).  Rocket, Criterion, Crossterm's execute, etc.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<li>&quot;I've written a bit of rust before, but rust is my first introduction to Async. My main gripes are that it's hard to figure our what the &quot;blessed&quot; way of doing async is. I'd love to see async included in the book, but I understand that async is still evolving too much for that.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Adding to the confusion: theres multiple executors, and they have a bit of lock in. Async libraries being dependent on which executor version I use is also confusing for newcomers. In other langs, it seems like one just uses everything from the stdlib and everything is compatible&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;That kind of gave me a lot of hesitation/fomo in the beginning, because it felt like I had to make some big choices around my tech stack that I felt I would be stuck with later. I ended up chatting about this in the discord &amp; researching for multiple days before getting started.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Also, due to there not being a &quot;blessed&quot; approach, I don't know if I'm working with some misconceptions around async in rust, and will end up discovering I will need to redo large parts of what I wrote.&quot;</li>
